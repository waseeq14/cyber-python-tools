# cyber-python-tools

Some basic cybersecurity scripts I wrote back in my **1st semester** when I was just starting to learn Python.

## Scripts inside 

* `arp_detector.py` → Detect ARP spoofing attempts
* `arp_spoof.py` / `arp_spoof2.py` → ARP spoofing practice scripts
* `dns_spoof.py` → Basic DNS spoofing example
* `mac_changer.py` → Change your system’s MAC address
* `network_scanner.py` → Scan devices on your network
* `packet_sniffer.py` → Capture packets and peek inside traffic
* `file_injector.py` / `code_injector.py` → Simple injection experiments

## Notes

* Probably full of bugs lol

## Why this repo?

I wanted to document my first baby steps into the field. Looking back, it’s fun to see how it all started.
